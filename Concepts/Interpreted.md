# Livescript
On the 90's there was a necessity of a programing languaje that runs as a  client-side to avoid </br>
the excess of information being exchaged from the computer to the server and viceversa. </br>Client-side scripts are commonly used when we want to validate data before sending it to the web server, adjusting the interface in response to user feedback, and for implementing other advanced features.
And that is how LiveScript was born, then just fot marketing it adopts the name of JavaScript since Java was a very popular languaje at that time (but they are not related at all‚ùó)

# JavaScript as an Interpreted Language
## Interpreted Languages
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. That means that the code is not being compiled, it's being 
readed line by line and executed at the time.  If we run a code written in JavaScript in a web browser, as it is happening, such as after loading the page we are currently reading the interpreter will be the JavaScript engine built into the browser
