## Interpreted Languages
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. That means that the code is not being compiled, it's being 
readed line by line and executed at the time.  If we run a code written in JavaScript in a web browser, as it is happening, such as after loading the page we are currently reading the interpreter will be the JavaScript engine built into the browser
